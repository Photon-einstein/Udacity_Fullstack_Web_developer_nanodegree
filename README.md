# Udacity_Fullstack_Web_developer_nanodegree

## Summary
The Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program equips students with the essential skills to build and deploy 
dynamic web applications. Through hands-on projects, learners gain proficiency in front-end technologies like 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end frameworks such as Flask and SQLAlchemy. 
The curriculum covers RESTful APIs, database management, and deployment strategies, enabling students to create 
robust applications that can handle user interactions and data storage.

## 1 - Project Fyyur

Fyyur is a web application designed to help users discover and manage live music events. Built using Flask and 
SQLAlchemy, this project allows users to create, view, and manage events, as well as register for them. 
The application features user authentication, event filtering, and a responsive design to enhance the user experience. 
Fyyur serves as a practical demonstration of the application of Flask and SQLAlchemy, with creation and managing of a 
database in the backend, ensuring that the data is checked before it is passed to the database.
